This directory is the utilities for keeping things going.


Ongoing maintenance:
1) When there's an update to https://kb.vmware.com/kb/2143832, update utils/raw_data_from_KB.txt
2) Run `utils/matchup-bios-to-string.pl --dump --minor` and verify that we have covered all 'update X' releases.  (minor patches no, major updates yes)
3) run `make` to rebuild the JSON and the facter ruby file, even if it's incomplete.
4) run `utils/missing_dmidecodes.pl < raw_data_from_KB.txt` to see who needs to be bios-analyzed that you haven't done yet:
5) When new releases happen, install a host, boot a Linux guest, and save off a run of `dmidecode -t bios` as dmidecode/dmidecode.NUM.txt, where NUM is the build number reported by ESX.
6) rerun `make` now that you have more dmidecodes
7) Commit and publish.
