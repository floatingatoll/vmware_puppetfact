This directory is the utilities for keeping things going.


Ongoing maintenance:
1) When there's an update to https://kb.vmware.com/kb/2143832, update utils/raw_data_from_KB.txt
2) When new releases happen, install a host, boot a Linux guest, and save off a run of `dmidecode -t bios` as dmidecode/dmidecode.NUM.txt, where NUM is the build number reported by ESX.
3) run make to rebuild the JSON and the facter ruby file.
